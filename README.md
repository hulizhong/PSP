Predict Stock Prices By ML


-------------------------------refer: https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-projects-for-beginners
The stock market is like candy-land for any data scientists who are even remotely interested in finance.

First, you have many types of data that you can choose from. You can find prices, fundamentals, global macroeconomic indicators, volatility indices, etc... the list goes on and on.
Second, the data can be very granular. You can easily get time series data by day (or even minute) for each company, which allows you think creatively about trading strategies.

Finally, the financial markets generally have short feedback cycles. Therefore, you can quickly validate your predictions on new data.

Some examples of beginner-friendly machine learning projects you could try include...

Quantitative value investing... Predict 6-month price movements based fundamental indicators from companies' quarterly reports.
Forecasting... Build time series models, or even recurrent neural networks, on the delta between implied and actual volatility.
Statistical arbitrage... Find similar stocks based on their price movements and other factors and look for periods when their prices diverge.
Obvious disclaimer: Building trading models to practice machine learning is simple. Making them profitable is extremely difficult. Nothing here is financial advice, and we do not recommend trading real money.
